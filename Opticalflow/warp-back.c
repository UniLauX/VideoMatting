File: warp.c

Synopsis: Warp an image based on the flow filed (u,v).

Status: This is EXPERIMENTAL code.  There is no guarantee.

Details: This does bi-linear interpolation.

Backwards warp

/*
Backwards warp of "image" by (u,v).  The result is stored in "warped".
Pixel values are determined by linearly interpolating the warped image.
While this is fairly fast, a better interpolation may be desirable.
